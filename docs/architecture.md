# Architecture Overview

Kinetic automates the process of running Python functions on Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) accelerators. It handles packaging, infrastructure provisioning,
and execution management to provide a seamless experience for remote workloads.

## Execution Lifecycle

When a function decorated with `@kinetic.run()` or `@kinetic.submit()` is
called, the system follows these steps:

1.  **Context Resolution**: Kinetic aggregates function parameters, environment variables, and local configurations into a unified `JobContext`.
2.  **Credential Validation**: The system verifies active `gcloud` and `kubectl` credentials, performing automatic configuration where necessary to ensure access to GCP services.
3.  **Artifact Preparation**:
    *   **Data Dependencies**: Local data paths are hashed and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) if they are not already present in the content-addressed cache.
    *   **Function Serialization**: The decorated function and its closure are serialized using `cloudpickle`.
    *   **Project Packaging**: The local working directory is compressed into a ZIP archive, automatically excluding paths managed by the Data API.
4.  **Container Image Management**: Kinetic generates a hash of project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`). If a corresponding image does not exist in Artifact Registry, Kinetic initiates a Cloud Build job to create it.
5.  **Job Submission**: Based on the requested accelerator type, Kinetic submits a Kubernetes Job (for GKE) or a LeaderWorkerSet (for multi-host Pathways) to the target cluster.
6.  **Remote Execution**: The remote pod pulls the container image, retrieves the serialized artifacts, mounts the required data volumes, and executes the function.
7.  **Result Retrieval**: Upon completion, the function's return value is retrieved from GCS, deserialized, and returned to the local Python process.
