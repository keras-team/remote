# Configuration

Kinetic uses environment variables, decorator arguments, and CLI flags
for configuration. This page is the source of truth for what each one
does, what the defaults are, and how the four come together when they
disagree.

## Environment variables

Variable                     | Used by                   | Default                          | Description
---------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`KINETIC_PROJECT`            | CLI + decorators          | _(required)_                     | GCP project ID. Falls back to `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` if unset.
`KINETIC_ZONE`               | CLI + decorators          | `us-central1-a`                  | GCP zone for jobs and clusters.
`KINETIC_CLUSTER`            | CLI + decorators          | `kinetic-cluster`                | GKE cluster name.
`KINETIC_NAMESPACE`          | CLI + decorators          | `default`                        | Kubernetes namespace.
`KINETIC_BASE_IMAGE_REPO`    | Decorator (prebuilt mode) | `kinetic`                        | Repo for prebuilt base images. See [Execution Modes](guides/execution_modes.md).
`KINETIC_OUTPUT_DIR`         | CLI + remote pod          | `gs://{bucket}/outputs/{job_id}` | Per-job durable artifact prefix. See [Checkpointing](guides/checkpointing.md).
`KINETIC_RESERVATION`        | `kinetic pool add`        | _(unset)_                        | GCP capacity reservation to consume. Pool-level config, not a per-job setting.
`KINETIC_LOG_LEVEL`          | Library                   | `INFO`                           | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`.
`KINETIC_STATE_DIR`          | Library                   | `~/.kinetic/pulumi`              | Pulumi state directory used by `kinetic up`/`down` when the local file backend is in use.
`KINETIC_STATE_BACKEND`      | CLI (infra cmds)          | `local`                          | Pulumi state backend. One of `local`, `gcs` (auto-bucket per project), or `gs://bucket[/prefix]` (custom). See [Shared state for team collaboration](#shared-state-for-team-collaboration).
`KINETIC_SETTINGS_FILE`      | Library                   | `~/.kinetic/settings.json`       | Override path for the persisted global-settings store written by `kinetic config set`.
`KINETIC_DEBUG_WAIT_TIMEOUT` | Library + remote pod      | `600`                            | Seconds the remote pod waits for a debugger client to attach when `debug=True`. Applies on both sides (local `debug_attach()` and the pod's debugpy server).

Set them in your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) so they
persist across sessions:

```bash
export KINETIC_PROJECT="my-gcp-project-id"
export KINETIC_ZONE="us-central1-a"
```

## Precedence

When the same setting can come from multiple sources, the highest one
wins:

Setting         | Decorator arg      | CLI flag                         | Env var                                         | Profile / global setting             | Built-in default
--------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------
Project         | `project=`         | `--project`                      | `KINETIC_PROJECT` (then `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`) | profile `project`                    | _(required)_
Zone            | `zone=`            | `--zone`                         | `KINETIC_ZONE`                                  | profile `zone`                       | `us-central1-a`
Cluster         | `cluster=`         | `--cluster`                      | `KINETIC_CLUSTER`                               | profile `cluster`                    | `kinetic-cluster`
Namespace       | `namespace=`       | `--namespace`                    | `KINETIC_NAMESPACE`                             | profile `namespace`                  | `default`
State backend   | _(n/a)_            | `--state-backend`                | `KINETIC_STATE_BACKEND`                         | profile `state_backend` → settings   | `local` (`file://~/.kinetic/pulumi`)
Output dir      | `output_dir=`      | `--output-dir`                   | `KINETIC_OUTPUT_DIR`                            | _(n/a)_                              | `gs://{bucket}/outputs/{job_id}`
Base image repo | `base_image_repo=` | `kinetic build-base --repo`      | `KINETIC_BASE_IMAGE_REPO`                       | _(n/a)_                              | `kinetic`
Reservation\*   | _(n/a)_            | `kinetic pool add --reservation` | `KINETIC_RESERVATION`                           | _(n/a)_                              | _(unset)_

\* Reservation is a node-pool-level setting, not a per-job one. You bind
a reservation to a pool when you create the pool with `kinetic pool add`,
and any job that lands on that pool consumes it. Because of that there is
no decorator argument; jobs select pools indirectly via `accelerator=`.

Read left to right: a decorator argument always beats a CLI flag, which
beats an env var, which beats the built-in default. Concretely:

```python
@kinetic.run(accelerator="tpu-v6e-8", project="explicit-project")
def train(): ...
```

uses `explicit-project` even if `KINETIC_PROJECT` is set to something
else.

## Logging

Kinetic uses `absl-py` for logging. Set `KINETIC_LOG_LEVEL` to control
verbosity:

- **DEBUG** — packaging details, dependency hashing, build pipeline,
  GKE submission.
- **INFO** — major lifecycle milestones (default).
- **WARNING / ERROR / FATAL** — only the named severity and above.

```bash
export KINETIC_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## Shared state for team collaboration

By default, `kinetic up` writes Pulumi state to `~/.kinetic/pulumi` on the
local machine. That works for a single admin, but two people running
`kinetic up` against the same GCP project will see independent copies of
the stack and can clobber each other's infrastructure. To share one
authoritative state across a team, point Kinetic at a Google Cloud
Storage bucket.

### Opting in

Pick whichever fits your workflow. All forms of opt-in produce the same
final URL — pick one and keep team members on the same value.

1. **Global setting (no profile required).** Persisted in
   `~/.kinetic/settings.json`; applies to every kinetic invocation that
   doesn't override it.

   ```bash
   # Auto-derived bucket name: gs://{your-gcp-project}-kinetic-state
   kinetic config set state-backend gcs

   # Or an explicit bucket — useful when several teams share a GCP project.
   kinetic config set state-backend gs://acme-platform/kinetic-state

   # Revert to local state.
   kinetic config unset state-backend
   ```

2. **Per-profile.** When the team has multiple infra targets and not all
   of them share state, encode the choice in the profile.

   ```bash
   kinetic profile create prod   # picks 'gcs' or 'custom' interactively
   ```

3. **Per-invocation.** Useful for one-off destroys or testing.

   ```bash
   KINETIC_STATE_BACKEND=gs://acme-platform/kinetic-state kinetic up
   kinetic up --state-backend gcs
   ```

### Bucket naming and creation

Without an explicit URL, Kinetic uses `gs://{project}-kinetic-state` —
GCS bucket names are globally unique, so prefixing with the GCP project
ID keeps team buckets distinct. The bucket is created on first use, with
**versioning enabled** and **uniform bucket-level access**, no public
ACL. Subsequent admins running against the same configuration find the
bucket already there and reuse it.

### IAM

Kinetic uses Application Default Credentials, the same auth path as
`gcloud`. The first admin needs `roles/storage.admin` on the project to
create the bucket. After that, every team member only needs
`roles/storage.objectAdmin` on the bucket itself to read and write
state — Kinetic deliberately does not check for `storage.buckets.get`
on subsequent runs, so collaborators without bucket-level read still
proceed straight to Pulumi.

### Migrating an existing local stack to GCS

Pulumi ships first-class export/import commands. With `pulumi` on your
PATH (the same binary Kinetic auto-installs into `~/.kinetic/pulumi-cli`):

```bash
# 1. Export the local stack.
pulumi --cwd . stack export --stack {project}-{cluster} > stack.json

# 2. Switch Kinetic to the GCS backend.
kinetic config set state-backend gcs

# 3. Initialize the stack on the new backend and import.
pulumi stack init {project}-{cluster}
pulumi stack import --file stack.json
```

After this, `kinetic up`/`pool add`/etc will read and write the GCS
bucket.

## Where to look

If a setting isn't behaving the way you expect, `kinetic config` prints
the resolved value of the most common variables (project, zone,
cluster, namespace, output dir, the Pulumi state backend, and — when
the backend is `file://` — the local state dir) and where each came
from. Run it before reaching for `kinetic doctor`.
Variables that aren't shown there (`KINETIC_BASE_IMAGE_REPO`,
`KINETIC_RESERVATION`, `KINETIC_LOG_LEVEL`, `KINETIC_DEBUG_WAIT_TIMEOUT`)
can be inspected with `env | grep KINETIC_`.
