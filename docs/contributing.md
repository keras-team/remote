## Contribution process

### Development setup

1. Install the package with development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Code quality and testing

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your changes pass linting and unit tests.

- **Linting:** We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. Run it with:
  ```bash
  ruff check .
  ```
- **Unit tests:** We use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for unit tests. Run them with:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- **E2E tests:** End-to-end tests run real workloads against a GKE cluster. They live in `tests/e2e/` and are skipped by default unless explicitly enabled.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - A GCP project with a provisioned GKE cluster (see [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start))
  - Google Cloud SDK authenticated (`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`)
  - GKE credentials configured: `gcloud container clusters get-credentials <KINETIC_CLUSTER> --zone <KINETIC_ZONE> --project <KINETIC_PROJECT>`
  - Test dependencies installed: `pip install -e ".[test,cli]"`

  **Required environment variables:**

  | Variable          | Required | Default         | Description                    |
  | ----------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
  | `E2E_TESTS`       | Yes      | —               | Set to `1` to enable e2e tests |
  | `KINETIC_PROJECT` | Yes      | —               | Google Cloud project ID        |
  | `KINETIC_ZONE`    | No       | `us-central1-a` | GKE cluster zone               |
  | `KINETIC_CLUSTER` | No       | `kinetic`        | GKE cluster name               |

  **Run all e2e tests:**

  ```bash
  E2E_TESTS=1 KINETIC_PROJECT=my-project python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v -n auto
  ```

  **Run a specific test file:**

  ```bash
  E2E_TESTS=1 KINETIC_PROJECT=my-project python -m pytest tests/e2e/cpu_execution_test.py -v
  ```

  Drop `-n auto` to run tests serially to make it easier to debug.
