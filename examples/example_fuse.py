"""GCS FUSE examples: lazy-mount data instead of downloading it.

Passing ``fuse=True`` to ``Data(...)`` tells Kinetic to mount the data via the
GCS FUSE CSI driver rather than downloading it into the container. This is
useful for large datasets where you only need to read a subset of the files at
runtime.

Prerequisites:
  * A GKE cluster with the GCS FUSE CSI driver addon enabled
    (``kinetic up`` enables it by default).

Note on local vs. remote execution:
The examples below create local temp directories and pass them to
``@kinetic.run`` functions. Although the data starts on your laptop,
Kinetic uploads it to GCS behind the scenes and then *mounts* it back
into the remote pod via the GCS FUSE CSI driver: the pod never
downloads a full copy. This is the key difference from the default
behaviour (``fuse=False``), where data is downloaded into the container
before execution.
