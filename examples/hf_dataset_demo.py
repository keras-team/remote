"""Hugging Face Dataset Demo for Kinetic.

This script demonstrates how to use Hugging Face datasets in a Kinetic job.
It downloads the dataset on the remote pod and makes it available to your function.

Note: To run this demo with a gated or private dataset, you must set the
`HF_TOKEN` environment variable in your environment before running this script.
